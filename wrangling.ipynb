        "- It requires your full cognitive attention, or your results will be garbage that makes everyone less informed, knowledgeable, and productive (\"GIGO\")\n",
        "- What are the consequences for society if you do a garbage analysis of bonds and sentencing?\n",
        "- We can't get this deeply into every variable in the data, but we must do it for the key ones for our analysis\n",
